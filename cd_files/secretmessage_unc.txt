Thank you to all the TAs for such an excellent job all year. You are all very helpful in answering questions and explaining any confusions we may have, whether about our projects or in lab. You are always patient and considerate. I also appreciate how well you run the labs and keep them organized. You guys do an excellent job of running things smoothly. I really appreciate all that you do.
